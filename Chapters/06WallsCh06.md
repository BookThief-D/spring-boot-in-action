* An introduction to Grails 3 and Spring Boot

When I was growing up, there was a series of television advertisements involving two people, one enjoying a chocolate bar and another eating peanut butter out of a jar. By way of some sort of comedic mishap, the two would collide, resulting in the peanut butter and chocolate getting mixed.

One would proclaim, “You got your chocolate in my peanut butter!” The other would respond, “You got peanut butter on my chocolate!”

After initially being angry with their circumstances, the two would conclude that the combination of peanut butter and chocolate is a good thing. Then a voice-over would suggest that the viewer should eat a Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup.

From the moment that Spring Boot was announced, I’ve been frequently asked how to choose between Spring Boot and Grails. Both are built upon the Spring Framework and both help ease application development. Indeed, they’re very much like peanut butter and chocolate. Both are great, but the choice is largely a personal one.

As it turns out, there’s no reason to choose one or the other. Just like the chocolate vs. peanut butter debate, Spring Boot and Grails are two great choices that work great together.

In this chapter, we’re going to look at the connection between Grails and Spring Boot. We’ll start by looking at a few Grails features like GORM and Groovy Server Pages (GSP) that are available in Spring Boot. Then we’ll flip it around and see how Grails 3 has been reinvented by being built upon Spring Boot.
